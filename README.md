# Minimal ready to use Gatsby dev env for Mac using Docker
Starter (gatsby-starter-hello-world) with the bare essentials needed for a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site

## Dev dependencies

 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (with Compose) 
 - [Docker Sync](docker-sync.io)

## Running in development
Ensure Docker Sync is started (can take a long time):
```
docker-sync start
```

Start Gatsby:
```
docker-compose up
```
